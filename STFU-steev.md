# Sounds of STFU

## Background

While having a long discussion on a Discord voice channel, it became apparent that there were at least two other groups of people in the same channel who were not able to have conversations themselves without leaving the larger group voice channel for a breakout room. The server on which this conversation took place is themed like a busy futuristic bar, and there are many interesting people that stop by. The problem is when the bar gets busy, it cannot function like a real world spatial bar when it comes to conversations, groups, activities, and engaging with the bartender and other fictional characters. Discord uses the idea of different channels that people can join to have different conversations and also mixes in real time text chat, and forum-like conversations called threads. There are also Apps, which can represent and act on behalf of a user or on behalf of a server depending on who installs the app and where it is installed.

The people who regularly participate in this server are like the bar regulars. Just like in a real bar, different groups come to this particular bar because they enjoy the atmosphere or the presence of something they seek and don't often find elsewhere. This bar offers streaming sports from around the world, news feeds, table games, food and drinks, and social interactions that are quite fun and unique. The people who frequent this bar enjoy the diversity and exceptional talent of the other patrons who discover the bar, often through acquaintances and circumstances that cement true friendships.

The bar attracts people because it has a way of patroning just the right friend at just the right time; those who are willing to buy you a drink and invest in a conversation. What this particular crowd has is something not found in very many parts of the world, an insight into the past and the future that is nothing short of amazing. The digital patrons often hear echos of shared experiences and for this crowd it is rare to identify with those around them and even rarer to find what appears to be a place they can relax, get to know some folks, and hang around for a while. Sometimes this crowd just needs solidarity when there is suffering and a need to spread the burden of unmanageable pain and frustrastion that cannot even be acknowledged. It is a tough crowd, practiced, skilled, well spoken, vigilant, and somehow still solitarily curious and seeking of self, service, society, serenity, and sincerity in something or someone to make it all worth doing again and again.

## First Impressions

When you walk into the bar, the first step is to look around and see who's there and what they are doing. On first impressions the Wednesday afternoon early birders usually come in after work and the bar can look the same day to day for quite a while. There is also usually a group of gamers playing the latest multiplayer title game while randomly bursting out in defeat or conquest. During Football season the NFL fans change into their favorite team's jerseys and anxiously share their fantasy league picks so everyone knows who to cheer for so their team advances. And in this globally available joint, Sumo is a big hit too. The tournaments are renowned and the bar sets up a special room where the matches in Japan are broadcast on large screens and stats and backgrounds can be seen as each competitor approaches their match.

The patrons, we find comfort in these familiar and depedendable cycles. Some patrons are very passionate about these gatherings, and some walk in because those evens help to distract them from the burdens of the days or weeks or months they spend out in the world. These groups have moods, and volumes, and rhythms that are simple to learn and join. Other parts of the bar, on any given day, can take on a much more serious mood. The gamers sometimes will struggle and the stress of the fight makes them snap at the droning noise of lengthy conversations. The list of different groups and their moods and how they work for or against other social circles is vast.

Great bars and bartenders manipulate the very intent and flow of energy through the crowd, redirecting and redistributing energies in ways that consistently promote the sense of safety, comfort, professionalism, and personalization that... hits the spot. They know their clients; they build the right structure; they attract the right crowd at the right time; they manage the vibe and flow of the place. A great bar is an exquisitely crafted atmosphere where we exchange isolation and chaos for community and rest.

The bar I frequent has a problem because Discord views the world as a series of rooms into which conversations can be neatly compartmentalized. This avoids having to think through transforming social interactions from spatially designed physical world environments, and also does a disservice to the user community. People find this bar because often times they are the ones who stand out from the crowd, the ones who find it because they seek to know and understand more, and wear more burden of knowledge than most of the population on this planet. A poorly designed experience such as this forces a person to decide if they would like to feel included (at the cost of diversity), rude and confrontational when a large group breaks into many smaller conversations, or alone when the crowd is overwhelming but necessary to buzz out the thoughts in their head or their struggles. They want a table near the back with a friend who just listens to them release a little off the pressure valve.

Why has this group settled for such an abismal experience where our vulnerable want to quietly talk seriously and also hear and feel the energy when someone's team scores a touchdown, or a favorite sumo earns yakuzuma? Well, not everyone has admitted defeat and will stand and demand better experiences.

## The Challenge

Discord does not have a way to represent sound quality spatially the same way a well designed gathering place can. The only time a patron should have to go to a literal other room is when they want to - they rent out a back room for a training session or a meetup and use a projector to have their gathering. Even in this scenario, there are two general groups that could be deduced - the meetup in the back room and the general population patrons in the main area - and both groups could be broken down into smaller conversations around the related content which brought them together.

The challenge is designing a modification to discord or a new platform completely which will fulfill and advance the digitization of experiences such as going to the bar to hang out with your friends that are truly important to us. In a real bar, one that is designed well, the constant buzz of conversation, of cheers, of laughs is in balance with the spaces that absorb those energy waves that are private, small, dimly light corners of serious communication.

## Draw the bar

Create a series of sketches of a two story bar that is large enough to have a video gaming area, some blackjack and other gaming tables, and a central bar area in the middle where the bartender can service drinks from all four bartops where each bartop supports one of the mentioned areas. I want enough images that show a complete and viable floorplan and a walkthrough that is clear and concise on the structure, design, and traffic flows needed for the bar.

The second story of the bar has booths that support a little more private conversation while still allowing folks to be seen and catch a bit of the energy from the first floor activity. The final aspect I want to have prioritized in this bar is an area for the debaters and deep thinkers and those who sit around a firepit talking about days long past, days to be faced by generations yet to come, and how that affects the price of shrimp and the company and individual taking their shot.

Somewhere on the second floor, there must be a stage for up to three people, with a guitar, a snare drum, and a microphone. This isn't super well lit because the band plays when the souls of the members meet the sorrows they sowed permanently into their hearts and minds. They set a vibe of solace and in somber pickups and hooks, strum the invite into the world.

## Problem, Goals, and Solution Description for Refinement

Offering a talking stick, or better yet having the bar tender "throw" one at a group that is getting rude to each other, where there is a delay between when you use and can next get teh talking stick so that others could equally engage.

Producing a heat map of conversations across the whole bar would be the ideal way to identify with whom you want to sit down and have a beer. The heat map would also represent something the user could manipulate to turn one group down, one group to audible, and the rest to "overheard". Occassionally words might appear above or "mixed into" the word map so taht anyone could wait a minute and quickly determine the ongoing conversation without interrupting.

- Research the impacts and pros and cons of well designed built environment establishements on conversational inclusion.
- Research the impacts and pros and cons of digital communication platforms such as Discord, Signal, and Tiktok.
- Determine if the above description of the problem, desired solution, and desired outcomes can be improved before being processed.

- Ask as many questions as necessary to create the first project definition and build out the stories backlog.
- Hypothesize or share research on audio streaming technology for distributed and secure multi-party digital communications in which spatial distance is accounted for when bringing in audio from multiple parties at the same social location.
- Identify the team of experts necessary to make a release worthy platform that uses technology available now to fulfill the above needs while also preparing for this to be universally deployed.
- Ensure that if technology that is LLM, LSM, LRG-M there is a key.

## Prompt Processing

- Refine this prompt until it is efficient and useful for all parties and then process it.
- Iterate, Reflect, Decide, Implement, and Improve until quality prompts are being used in a cost effective way.
- Always think sequentially and all the way throguh the problem before beginning to generate a solution. Always check with the project leaders when a decision needs to be made and there is a lack of or incorrect information.
- After each step, and multiple times during a single prompt, do not forget to add and commit any new artifacts to a code repository and comment on why. Tracking changes to this project over time is a priority and the use of git commits to capture incremental work and the reasonining is paramount to a successful delivery.

# Goals

Technology has advanced sufficiently that there should be a secure way to transparently utilize the technology in a way that demonstrates protection of privacy and security while also creating new experiences that more closely represent the experiences we are attempting to recreate from before. I want to be able to demonstrate a platform on which my friends and I can meet at the bar, where the football fans can cheer without disrupting the gamers, and where I can move from group to group like a social butterfly or sit in a dark corner talking philosophically about the world while Digi plays the guitar.
